# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction - Telecom industry 
*A Data Science project to predict which customers are likely to leave... before they actually do.*


## 🌟 What is Customer Churn?

**Churn** refers to when a customer stops using a company’s service.  
In the telecom world, **customer churn** means users cancel their subscription or switch to a competitor.

---

## 📌 Why is Customer Churn Important?

- Acquiring new customers is **5x more expensive** than retaining current ones.  
- High churn leads to **revenue loss**, **marketing costs**, and **brand damage**.  
- Predicting churn lets businesses **act early**—offering support, discounts, or better service.
  
---

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a customer will churn based on their usage, service type, and demographic information.

---

## 📂 Dataset Used

- **Source**: Public telecom customer dataset  
- **Features**:
  - Customer info: gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents  
  - Account info: contract type, internet service, monthly charges, tenure  
  - Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

| Tool/Library         | Purpose                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Python               | Core programming language        |
| Pandas, NumPy        | Data cleaning and manipulation   |
| Seaborn, Matplotlib  | Exploratory data analysis        |
| Scikit-learn         | Model building and evaluation    |

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – Fix missing values, remove duplicates  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Encode and scale features  
3. **Model Building** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more  
4. **Evaluation** – Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC  
5. **Prediction** – Generate churn predictions for new data  
6. **(Optional)** Power BI dashboard for business insights

## ✅ Project Outcome

- Achieved **82 %** on test data 
- Highlighted key churn indicators: 
  - High monthly charges  
  - Low tenure (new users churn more)  
- Built a model to help telecom providers **reduce churn and improve retention**

---

## 📌 Key Business Insights

- Customers with **short-term contracts** are at high risk  
- **No tech support or online security services** often leads to churn  
- Loyal customers (high tenure) churn less  
- Proactive strategies can be built using model predictions

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate model with CRM systems  
- Automate churn alerts  
- Use advanced techniques like deep learning or XGBoost  
- Deploy with Flask API or Streamlit for live prediction

This project is a great example of how data science can solve real-world business problems.  
It combines **technical modeling** with **actionable insights** for business decision-makers.
